SuperResolution.Filter.Desc="AI Super Resoltuion is a GPU intensive upscaling operation that in my testing applies a sharpening and smoothing filter that attempts to keep the perceived visuals of the original image.\nGenerally this means that outlines tend to stay thinner and more detailed, without fading gradients over such a large area.\nThis is extremelly noticable on text edges and outlines.\n\nUpscaling is a non-AI, but still GPU accelerated method of upscaling producing different results more similar to upscaling methods like Bicbuic and Lancsoz but clearer and generally without the sharpening halo that lanczos produces."

SuperResoltuion.SRMode.Desc="Weak mode will apply a harder blending effect, which can remove very fine subtle details but can also keep lines thicker. Can also be used to blend subtle dithering into a smooth gradient.\nStrong mode attempts to recreate the original image as closely as possible, imperfections and all. Will have a sharpening halo effect on lower resolution source material using large upscale multipliers"
SuperResolution.AR="AI Artifact Reduction Pre-Pass"
SuperResolution.ARDesc="This WILL alter the color of your image. This has a non-zero GPU impact in both utilization and VRAM use. Attempts to remove minor compression artifacts from the image. This will not remove extreme compression artifacting, but may smooth it out better than nothing"
SuperResolution.ARMode="AR Mode"
SuperResolution.ARMode.Weak="Mode 0 (Enhances less and removes more encoding artifacts and is suited for lower-quality videos)"
SuperResolution.ARMode.Strong="Mode 1 (Enhances more and is suited for higher quality lossless videos)"
SuperResolution.ARMode.Desc="Mode 0 seemingly attempts to keep more subdued details of the image, and applies less agressive blending in some cases.\nMode 1 works ok on finer compression artifacting, but can blur our finer detail"
